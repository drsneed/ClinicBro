Structuring Your Codebase:
To better structure your codebase for adding more database models, consider the following approach:
a. Create a models directory:

Place all your model classes (like User) in this directory.
Each model should have its own file, e.g., user.dart, patient.dart, etc.

b. Create a services directory:

Place your DataService in this directory.
As your app grows, you might want to split the DataService into multiple service classes, each responsible for a specific model or group of related models.

c. Create a repositories directory:

Implement repository classes that act as an abstraction layer between your data source (API) and the rest of your application.
Each repository would use the DataService but provide a more domain-specific interface.

d. Use dependency injection:

Consider using a dependency injection framework like get_it to manage your service and repository instances.



Here's an example of how your project structure might look:
lib/
├── models/
│   ├── user.dart
│   └── patient.dart
├── services/
│   └── data_service.dart
├── repositories/
│   ├── user_repository.dart
│   └── patient_repository.dart
├── screens/
│   ├── user_list_screen.dart
│   └── patient_detail_screen.dart
└── main.dart
